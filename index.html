  <h1>What does this code do?</h1>
    <p>This code starts out by asking the user three guessing game questions and logging their answers in the variables question1, question2, question3. Next the code relays the answers given to the console.  Finally the user is alerted of their inputs for each question asked.</p>

    <p id="one"></p>
    <p id = "five"></p>
    <h4>Is Seattle awesome?</h4>
    <p id="two"></p>
    <p id = "six"></p>
    <h4>Is the answer to this question yes, or no?</h4>
    <p id="three"></p>
    <p id = "seven"></p>
